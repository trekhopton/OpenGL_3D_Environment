Textures can be png images with transparency, one of the pine tree models shows this.
The scene includes multiple blinn phong lights:

The scene also has fog or atmospheric perspective. Things appear whiter the further away from
the camera they are.

The user controls are as follows:

Esc: exits the window.

Cursor: controls direction of the current camera.
Right mouse up/down Zooms in/out.
Key C: Switches to different camera.
Key S: Switches shaders.
